# Getting Started

1. Introduction
This document provides guidelines for designing and developing a Java microservice that is scalable, maintainable, and extensible.

2. Modular Design and Microservices Architecture
•	I have broken down the application into smaller, focused microservices to enhance scalability and maintainability.
•	Each microservice handles specific functionality and communicate with others through APIs.

3. API Design
•	I have designed RESTful APIs with clear URL structures, HTTP methods, and status codes.

4. Scalability
•	We can utilize containerization (e.g., Docker) for consistent deployment. We can write docker file to create our custom image and write docker-compose file to create a suitable container.
•	Implement orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for managing and scaling containers. Using Kubernetes enables us to scale our application, so it can add resources to our instances as well as adding new instances.

5. Load Balancing
•	Implement a load balancer (e.g., Nginx) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple application instances.

6. Monitoring and Logging
•	Implement logging and monitoring using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
•	Monitor cache usage and performance to optimize caching strategies.

7. Testing
•	Write unit tests.
•	We can implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

8. Documentation
•	I have provided comprehensive documentation for developers, including API documentation and setup instructions.

9. Versioning
•	Design APIs with versioning in mind to ensure backward compatibility.

10. Extensibility
•	I have designed a modular architecture that allows for easy addition of new features.

11. Conclusion
By following these guidelines and best practices, we can build a scalable, maintainable, and extensible Java microservice.
